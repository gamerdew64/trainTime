# trainTime

##### This is a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

##### When adding trains, administrators will be able to submit the following:

    * Train Name
    * Destination
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    * Frequency -- in minutes

##### The app will then calculate when the next train will arrive, relative to the current time.
##### Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
